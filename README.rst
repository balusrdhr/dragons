* Common processing tasks for analysing simulation/model data (:ref:`munge`)
* Tools for common plotting tasks (:ref:`plotutils`)

Notes
-----

This package was born many, many years ago. Python packaging and infrastructure
has moved on a lot since then. Whilst we have made some effort to modernise the
package, there is still a lot of work to do. We are very open to contributions.

Whilst all of the code has been heavily tested in the field by
a number of people, it is sorely lacking unit tests.  This is a high priority
for this package.  Anyone who is interested or willing to help is encouraged to
contact the authors.
